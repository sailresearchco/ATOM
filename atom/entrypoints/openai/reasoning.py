A dialect-agnostic engine: it separates the reasoning channel from the final

    Some families close a reasoning block they never open: DeepSeek-R1 emits
    `</think>` but neither its prompt nor its output carries `<think>`. Nothing
    in a single response says so -- the first token is already reasoning and
    looks like an answer -- so it has to be known before the response starts.

    The chat template says it. A template that mentions an end marker and not
    the matching opener is describing exactly that shape; one that mentions
    both (Qwen3, MiniMax-M3) describes a model that opens its own, and one
    that mentions neither (gpt-oss) has no reasoning channel to speak of.

    ``template_source`` is the template's own text, which is the only place
    this shows: an end marker is what the template does with a *reply*, so it
    never reaches a fresh prompt. Measured -- Qwen3.5's source carries both
    markers while its rendered prompt carries only the opener, and Qwen3-8B's
    rendered prompt carries neither, so asking a render would answer False for
    every model alive. Get it from `chat_encoders.chat_template_source`, which
    also handles the two shapes that answer False by accident: a ``dict`` of
    named templates, and the ``None`` of a model that ships a Python encoder.

    This is what vLLM expresses by registering `DeepSeekR1ReasoningParser` for
    R1 -- an override whose only job is to treat a stream with no start token
    as reasoning until `</think>`. Same fact, derived instead of listed.
